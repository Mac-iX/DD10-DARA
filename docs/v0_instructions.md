# v0.dev Instructions for DARA & DIDI Frontend

## Prompt for v0.dev

```
Create a professional, minimalist web application interface for an AI-powered research tool called "DARA & DIDI". The design should be clean, modern, and intuitive, using a dark theme with blue and gold accents.

**Core Components:**

1.  **Main Layout:** A responsive, single-page application layout with a fixed sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right.

2.  **Sidebar:**
    *   A clean, cPanel-style sidebar.
    *   At the top, a logo for "Quality Creative Consulting".
    *   A primary button that says "+ New Research".
    *   A list of recent research "artifacts" (e.g., "Coffee Shop Research", "EV Adoption Study").

3.  **Main Content Area:**
    *   **Initial State:** A welcome screen with a large, central input form.
        *   Form fields: "What are you researching?", "Geographic Region", and a toggle for "I have existing data".
        *   A prominent "Start Research" button.
    *   **Processing State:** A clean loading screen that shows the DARA workflow progress (e.g., "✓ Foundational Research", "⏳ Persona Generation...").
    *   **Results State:** A well-formatted report display.
        *   The main DARA report is shown first.
        *   Below the report, a section titled "DIDI Enhancement Modules" with visual cards for each DIDI module (e.g., "Deep Quality Review", "Deep Signal Detection").
        *   Each card should have a brief description of what the module does.
        *   A button to "Run Selected Enhancements".

**Styling:**

*   **Framework:** Tailwind CSS
*   **Theme:** Dark mode
*   **Primary Colors:** Dark blue/gray background (e.g., `#0B1E3B`)
*   **Accent Colors:** Bright blue for interactive elements (e.g., `#00F0FF`) and gold for headings (e.g., `#D4AF37`).
*   **Typography:** A clean, modern sans-serif font (e.g., Inter).

**Interactivity:**

*   The sidebar should be collapsible on mobile.
*   The module cards should have a subtle hover effect.
*   The results display should be scrollable and easy to read.

**Code:**

*   Generate the UI using React and Next.js.
*   Use functional components with hooks.
*   Provide clean, well-commented code.
